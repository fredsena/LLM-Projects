    "## Step 8 - Define the nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "We now need to define a few different nodes in our graph.\n",
    "In LangGraph, a node can be either a function or a [runnable](https://python.langchain.com/docs/expression_language/).\n",
    "There are two main nodes we need for this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The agent (`run_agent`): responsible for deciding what (if any) actions to take.\n",
    "2. A function to invoke tools (`execute_tools`): if the agent decides to take an action, this node will then execute that action.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also need to define some edges.\n",
    "Some of these edges may be conditional.\n",
    "The reason they are conditional is that based on the output of a node, one of several paths may be taken.\n",
    "The path that is taken is not known until that node is run (the LLM decides).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Conditional Edge (`should_continue`): after the agent is called, we should either:\n",
    "   - If the agent said to take an action, then the function to invoke tools is called.\n",
    "   - If the agent said that it was finished, then it finishes.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. Normal Edge: after the tools are invoked, it should always go back to the agent to decide what to do next.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's define the nodes, as well as a function to decide how what conditional edge to take."
